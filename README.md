### Youtube-ANALYZER-API

for this you have to install following libraries:

pip install Pillow

pip install python-vlc

pip install pafy

pip install pytube

After installing these libraries you are ready to run the project.

## Tkinter

for the GUI , tkinter is used. Tkinter is the python library which is most common for making GUIs, for this purpose you can also use Pyqt5 but the main concern for this 
project is to learn the use of API not to create attactive GUIs. So for this I just create a simple GUI.

## Features

you have to search a channel of youtube for example channel is Pytroops. you just need to search it and the program brings all the video titles of the channel.


just select and any title and press the select button.

A new window will  appear with the video's thumbnail, play and download buttons, and stats of the video for example likes , dislikes, views , comments , duration etc

Click on play button and the program will play the video on VLC which is the library of python we used.

For downloading the video click on download button and wait of success message.

After you get a message successfully downloaded, you video is in your downloads folder.
